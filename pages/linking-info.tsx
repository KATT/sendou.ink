        This page explains how you can get your Top 500 and/or League placements
        linked to your sendou.ink user. You need to DM the bot{" "}
        <b>Lanista#5266</b> on{" "}
        <MyLink href="https://discord.gg/sendou" isExternal>
          Discord
        </MyLink>{" "}
        to set it up.
        <br />
        <br />
        Simply DM the bot with <code>!register</code> command and follow
        instructions. If you have problems using Lanista you can DM{" "}
        <b>Lean#3146</b> directly.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have already used the !register command in the past and just need
        to link now then use the <code>!sendoulink</code> command.
